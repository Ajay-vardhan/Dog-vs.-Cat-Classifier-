# Dog-vs.-Cat-Classifier-
A deep learning project that classifies images as either a dog or a cat using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of dog and cat images, and achieves high accuracy through data augmentation and model optimization techniques.
